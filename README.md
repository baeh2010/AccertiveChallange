# AccertiveChallange
this project is developed in .Net 4.7.2 it's a console application. to run it best download it and use visual studios to run it 
I replaced the spaces with dashes to allow me to better test if my solution is correct. 
there's an automated unit test project with test methods to allow you to test your input.
in the test method you'll have " Assert.AreEqual("put the actual correct solution here", the actual result here );"

to run the automated tests you can right click the solution and choose run test. or go to test in the nav bar and choose run tests
